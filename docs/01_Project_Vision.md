Project Vision: AI Resume Screener

Problem Statement

HR and SMEs often face challenges when shortlisting resumes, as some qualified candidates are underrepresented in traditional resume scoring. These candidates may have strong qualifications reflected on LinkedIn, but their resumes fail to capture this adequately. This can lead to missed opportunities for hiring the best talent.

Proposed Solution

Develop an AI-based resume screener that ranks resumes based on their content and job description while separately scoring LinkedIn activity. By fetching LinkedIn IDs from resumes and analyzing recent (last year) professional activities, the system will provide additional insights. The dashboard will present both scores separately and also include suggestions for resumes that have an average resume score but a high LinkedIn activity score. Users will be able to download the results as a CSV file.

MVP Goal

The MVP will include:

Resume upload functionality.

LinkedIn activity analysis (last year).

Ranking and scoring of candidates based on both sources.

Dashboard visualization.

CSV export of scores and ranks.

Target Audience

HR Managers: To streamline the hiring process and ensure no valuable candidates are overlooked.

Subject Matter Experts (SMEs): To validate candidates based on comprehensive profiles.
